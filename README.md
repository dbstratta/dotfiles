# Diego Stratta's dotfiles

## Information

As of today, it works only on Debian / Ubuntu with Unity 7.

It should still work with other desktop environments,
but I haven't tested it.

## Prerequisites

To clone the repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Debian / Ubuntu

```shell
$ sudo apt install git
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to home folder and run `install.sh`.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/strattadb/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles
$ . install.sh
```

## After the installation

* Disable showing the Ubuntu HUD with Alt key.
`Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Key to show the HUD`.

* Set up SSH keys to [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys),
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), etc.

* You may want to install proprietary drivers.
